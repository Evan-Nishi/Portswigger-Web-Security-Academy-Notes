# Portswigger Web Academy Notes

Hey this is my personal notebook for solving and working through the [portswigger academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security).  I find it super fun and although I was familiar with these vulns from CTFs, I've learned a lot!  The solutions are already posted for these labs, but I feel that some insight into why a problem works is helpful for review.
